Power Price is there to calculate & give insights on the usage and costs for any device.
It's optimised to work with dynamic or switching energy prices based on time of day.

1. Create a Power Price virtual device 
2. Choose the type of measuring you would like (kWh, W, m3, GJ, l, g, oz, gal, ft3)
3. In settings of the device you can optionally set the preferred currency
4. Use the device action cards to start, update & stop measuring of a usage session
5. The session outcome will be stored in the device and can be used inside flows to report the outcomes
